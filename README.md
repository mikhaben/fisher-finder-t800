# Fisher-finder-t800

### Note:
This is an experimental (learning only) project aimed at creating a World of Warcraft fishing bot. It uses OpenCV for detecting fishing bobbers and splashes, and PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse and keyboard actions, automating the fishing process in the game.

Features:
* Bobber and Splash Detection: Uses OpenCV for visual detection.
* Automated Fishing: Employs PyAutoGUI for control automation.
